# Massspectrometry-based Proteomcis introduction

The course will introduce MS-based proteomics data, it's basic processing and
the downstream analysis. The course will be a mix of lectures and hands-on session 
where we will perform the basic processing steps using quantms, a nextflow workflow, and
acore for the downstream analysis.
