This dataset contains the proteome profiling of a escherichia coli strain named
EPEC E2349/69 which showed the biggest growth response to an broccoli-derived antioxidant
called sulforaphane, which can be administered orally.

four of them are treated with 10 Î¼M sulforaphane. The aim is to compare the proteome between
both conditions.

Goals:
 - identify the impact of sulforaphane on the human gut microbiome (in anaerobic conditions
   of the gut)


Keywords:
- e.coli
- human gastrointestinal tract (anaerobic)
- prebiotics
- antiinflammatory
- anaerobic
