This dataset contains the proteome profiling of a escherichia coli strain nammed
EPEC E2349/69 which showed the biggest growth response to an broccoli-derived antioxidant
called sulforaphane, which can be administered orally.

The data contains eight samples. Four of them are control samples and 
four of them are treated with sulforaphane. The aim is to compare the proteome between
both conditions.
