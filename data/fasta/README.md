# Fasta file for searches

We provide protein sequences in fasta format of known proteins of ecoli and some potential
human contaminants. The mass spectra are search against these protein sequences by the 
specified search engines. 

The contaminants are known to enter the sample during the preparation and handling in 
the lab. Imagine some human skin or hair particles ending up in the sample tubes. Other 
contaminants are specific to proteins from commenly used lab media, which include certain
proteins.

## Files expected in this folder are:

```bash
merged_ecoli_with_contaminants.fasta
```
