# Example datasets

We tried to identify two smaller datasets from microbes and are able to present two
ecoli-datasets obtained from a bigger collection of E. coli projects. Thanks
to Caroline Jachmann for the great work assembling a peptide atlas with post translational
modifications for ecoli:

- [E. coli peptide atlas with phosphosites](https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000000625)

We consider the following datasets:


- [PXD040621](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD040621) - broccoli-derived antioxidant sulforaphane in human gut - [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464623002451)

- [PXD041301](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD041301) - membrane proteins in a time-course experiment - [article](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1361270/full)
